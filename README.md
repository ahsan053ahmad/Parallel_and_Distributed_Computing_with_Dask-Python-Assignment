# Parallel_and_Distributed_Computing_with_Dask-Python-Assignment
This repository contains my submission for exploring parallel and distributed computing using the Dask library in Python. The assignment emphasizes how to handle larger-than-memory datasets, perform parallel computations efficiently, and accelerate machine learning workflows on single and multiple cores.
